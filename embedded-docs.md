# Mongoose and Embedded Documents

What are embedded documents? Codealong

Embedded documents are just what they sound like: documents inside of other documents.
To define an embedded document in Mongoose, we will be nesting a Mongoose Schema inside of another Mongoose Schema.

The nested schema is equipped with all the same features as your models: defaults, validators, middleware, and even error handling, as they are tied to the save() error callback.

## Example

Let's look at these two schemas below - we can embed `childSchema` into the property `children`:

```javascript
var childSchema = new Schema({ name: 'string' });

var parentSchema = new Schema({
  children: [childSchema]
})

var Parent = mongoose.model('Parent', parentSchema);
var parent = new Parent({ children: [{ name: 'Matt' }, { name: 'Sarah' }] })
parent.children[0].name = 'Matthew';
parent.save(function(err) {
  if (err) return handleError(err);
  console.log('New Parent!');
});
```

Or from mongoDB official docs, we can look at this example with Patron and Address models:

```javascript
{
   _id: "joe",
   name: "Joe Bookreader"
}

{
   patron_id: "joe",
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345"
}

{
   patron_id: "joe",
   street: "1 Some Other Street",
   city: "Boston",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345"
}
```

The address documents make two references to the Joe Bookreader object, so instead we can:

```javascript
{
   _id: "joe",
   name: "Joe Bookreader",
   addresses: [
                {
                  street: "123 Fake Street",
                  city: "Faketon",
                  state: "MA",
                  zip: "12345"
                },
                {
                  street: "1 Some Other Street",
                  city: "Boston",
                  state: "MA",
                  zip: "12345"
                }
              ]
 }
 ```

Note that sub-documents do not save individually, only with the highest-level document; in this case, the addresses are saved with the Joe Bookreader Patron document.

#### Finding a sub-document

All documents in Mongoose have an  `_id`.  Look above at our Patron example.  Joe Bookreader has an `_id` of 'joe'.

> DocumentArrays have a special `id` method for looking up a document by its _id.

```javascript
// in our first example
var doc = parent.children.id(id_you_are_looking_for);

// in the second example
var doc = patron.addresses.id(id_you_are_looking_for)
```

#### Adding and Removing sub-docs

Remember Ruby methods like `pop`, `push`, or the `<<` operator?  We'll, Mongoose comes with MongooseArray methods like as `push`, `unshift`, `addToSet`, and others.  And just like adding them, we can remove them with `remove()`

Using code from the official docs, we can see how these are used:

```javascript
var Parent = mongoose.model('Parent');
var parent = new Parent;

// create a child
parent.children.push({ name: 'Liesl' });
var subdoc = parent.children[0];
console.log(subdoc) // { _id: '501d86090d371bab2c0341c5', name: 'Liesl' }
subdoc.isNew; // true

parent.save(function (err) {
  if (err) return handleError(err)
  console.log('Success!');
});

// remove

var doc = parent.children.id(id_you_are_looking_for).remove();
parent.save(function (err) {
  if (err) return handleError(err);
  console.log('the sub-doc was removed')
});

```

Sub-docs may also be created without adding them to the array by using the create method of MongooseArrays.

```javascript
var newdoc = parent.children.create({ name: 'Aaron' });
```
